This project is an algorithmic implementation of the Memory game, created as part of an advanced algorithm lab. The program is coded in Java using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern.

The MVC pattern defines the role of the three entities as follows:

- Model: Represents the business logic of the application.
- View: Defines the user interface.
- Controller: Handles event management to update the view or the model.

## How to Use the Program
To use the Memory game program, follow these steps:

Ensure that you have Java installed on your system.
Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.
Compile and run the program.
Follow the on-screen instructions to play the Memory game.

## Notes
The game follows the traditional rules of the Memory game, where players need to find pairs of matching images.
The game's user interface is not graphical; it is console-based.
Feel free to modify the code to add a graphical user interface or enhance the features of the game.
